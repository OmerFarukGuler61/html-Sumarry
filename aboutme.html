   <h1>About Omer Faruk Guler</h1> 
   <hr>
   <p>Hello! I was born in London in 2005 and recently finished my secondary education in 2023. <br>
    I live in Turkey and my main languages are Turkish and English. As an aspiring Web Developer, I'm set to commence my university studies in the 2023-2024 academic year. My current focus is mastering HTML, CSS, and Java to establish a robust foundation in web development. <br>
    My secondary school journey took place at a school in Istanbul Turkey, where I excelled in both literature and history. Outside my formal studies, I have a freelance portfolio that comprises tasks in Photoshop, video editing, and unique work translating Ottoman Turkish. 
    Literature, especially the deep dives into Classic Turkish literature, is my profound passion. This enthusiasm has spurred me to pen over twenty poems in the past two years and embark on authoring a novel. 
    <br>I'm also actively involved in content creation for a YouTube channel named 'Halat Medya' and personally oversee its content strategy on Instagram.
